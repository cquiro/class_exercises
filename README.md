Wyncode
=======
Adding files to a GitHub repo as an exercise.

These are four ruby files that are to be run from the terminal.

They were written at the beginning of the Wyncode course. Three of them involve manipulating
arrays and the other (beatles.rb) is to practice object oriented programming concepts.
